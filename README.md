# metaphactory deployments with docker-compose

**Prerequisites:**

* docker installed (version >= 20.10.0, check with `docker --version`)
* (optional) docker-compose installed (version >= 1.21.2, check with `docker-compose --version`)
  Please note that `docker-compose` is deprecated, and replaced by `docker compose`
* a Docker host system with `x86_64` / `amd64` or `aarch64` / `arm64` architecture.
  Please note that as of 4.5.0 metaphactory is shipped as a multi-architecture container image. When pulling the image the host will automatically select the right variant for the local architecture.
* outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic, allowing to access external Docker registries (e.g. Docker Hub or other private/corporate Docker registries)

## metaphactory Deployment and Maintenance

**Prerequisites:**

Please request your personal token to access our private docker hub registry via https://metaphacts.com/get-started (select "Docker - any graph database").

### Initial Deployment

The following instructions are tested and validated on Linux and macOS. If running on Windows, please use the PowerShell UI for maximum compatibility.

To create a new deployment, start as follows:

1. Clone this GIT repository with `git clone https://github.com/metaphacts/metaphactory-docker-compose.git`
2. Navigate to the created folder using `cd metaphactory-docker-compose`. Then create a copy of the `service-template` folder i.e. `cp -r service-template my-deployment`. The idea is to maintain one subfolder for every deployment.

Then, depending on which database backend you want to use, enter the newly created deployment directory using `cd my-deployment`, and choose an option:


#### metaphactory only - for use with existing graph databases

3. run `cp ./database-config/.env_default .env`
4. Open the file `.env` e.g. `vi .env` and perform following changes:
    1. Change the value of the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` variable to a unique name (default is `my-deployment-1`). The name will be used to prefix container names as well as `vhost` entry in the nginx proxy (if used).
5. If you want to connect to a SPARQL endpoint accessible only via the docker hostmachine, please see the instructions in the section [Accessing docker hostmachine from docker container](#accessing-docker-hostmachine-from-docker-container).
6. Run `docker compose up -d`. It is **important to run the command in the 'my-deployment' folder (containing the .env file)**, since docker-compose will pick up the `.env` file for parameterization.
7. Open `http://localhost:10214` and login with user `admin` and password `admin`

#### metaphactory with GraphDB

3. run `cp ./database-config/.env_graphdb .env`. 
4. Open the file `.env` e.g. `vi .env` and perform following changes:
    1. Change the value of the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` variable to a unique name (default is `my-deployment-1`). The name will be used to prefix container names as well as `vhost` entry in the nginx proxy (if used).


5. Please perform additional steps below to prepare the GraphDB configuration:
    1. (Optional) modify GraphDB-specific parameters in the `./database-config/docker-compose.graphdb.yml` file, for example changing the default memory settings, or modifying the location where GraphDB stores its data on the host machine (by default, in the directory `graphdb-data` in the deployment directory). 
    2. (Optional) modify the configuration of the default GraphDB database, which is automatically created on first boot. You can do so by editing `./database-config/graphdb-config/graphdb-repository-config.ttl`. For GraphDB 9.x please make sure to activate `./database-config/graphdb-config/graphdb9-repository-config.ttl` in `./database-config/docker-compose.graphdb.yml` (line 45f). If you wish to enable SHACL validation, a separate example configuration is provided in `./database-config/graphdb-config/graphdb-with-SHACL-config-example.ttl`.
    3. (Optional) you can also modify the `./database-config/graphdb-config/metaphactory.ttl` file, i.e. to use a different GraphDB database name or changing the default credentials for the repository connection with GraphDB. The credentials can optionally be externalized using the keys `repository.default.username` and `repository.default.password`, see https://help.metaphacts.com/resource/Help:ExternalizedSecrets for further details.

6. Run `docker compose up -d`. It is **important to run the command in the 'my-deployment' folder (containing the .env file)**, since docker-compose will pick up the `.env` file for parameterization.
7. GraphDB is started without a license pre-configured. In GraphDB 10 the database will operate in _Free Mode_, while for GraphDB 11 a license is required. To activate GraphDB SE/EE, a valid license can be set in the GraphDB workbench UI (http://localhost:7200). Note that a (trial) license can be requested through metaphacts. Alternatively, a license file can be mounted as volume through Docker by replacing `database-config/graphdb-config/license/graphdb.license` with a valid license and uncommenting the overridden _command_ of `database-config/docker-compose.graphdb.yml`.
8. Open `http://localhost:10214` and login with user `admin` and password `admin`
9. (Optional) For small and medium-sized databases you can create an out-of-the-box Lucene full-text search connector by running the query which is provided on the corresponding help page.
Please refer to http://localhost:10214/resource/Help:HowToConnectToGraphDB#full-text-search for more details. 

##### Compatibility with GraphDB versions

metaphactory is generally compatible with GraphDB 10 and GraphDB 11. We recommend using latest patch releases of the specific major versions, i.e., `GraphDB 10.8.8` or `GraphDB 11.0.1`. Specific versions can be adjusted in the `.env` file.


#### metaphactory with Stardog

 **Please note:** use of Stardog requires that you own a valid Stardog license file.

3. run `cp ./database-config/.env_stardog .env`.
4. Open the file `.env` e.g. `vi .env` and perform following changes:
    1. Change the value of the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` variable to a unique name (default is `my-deployment-1`). The name will be used to prefix container names as well as `vhost` entry in the nginx proxy (if used).
5. (Only for **metaphactory with Stardog**) Please perform additional steps below to prepare the Stardog configuration:
    1. Add your Stardog license into the `./database-config/stardog-config` folder by replacing the existing file `stardog-license-key.bin`. 
    2. You may want to modify Stardog specific parameters in the `./database-config/docker-compose.stardog.yml` file i.e. changing the default memory settings
    3. You can also modify the `./database-config/stardog-repository-config/myDB.ttl` file, i.e. to use a different Stardog database name or changing the default credentials for the repository connection with Stardog. The credentials can optionally be externalized using the keys `repository.default.username` and `repository.default.password`, see https://help.metaphacts.com/resource/Help:ExternalizedSecrets for further details. Please note that changes to the database name require modification of the database configuration in `./database-config/stardog-config/database-template.properties`.
 
6. Run `docker compose up -d`. It is **important to run the command in the 'my-deployment' folder (containing the .env file)**, since docker-compose will pick up the `.env` file for parameterization.
7. Run `docker compose exec stardog /opt/stardog/bin/stardog-admin db create -c /var/opt/stardog/database-template.properties -n myDB` to create a Stardog database. Also modify the database name from `myDB` to the name you used (e.g. if you modified the `myDB.ttl` file). 

**Please note:** For the creation of the stardog database the `stardog-config/database-template.properties` will be used. This is important, since this property file sets some database configurations (for example, enabling text search/indexing and querying of all named graphs) which are important to make metaphactory seamlessly work with Stardog.

8. Open `http://localhost:10214` and login with user `admin` and password `admin`

**Note:** we are running the Stardog container as `root` user to avoid restricted volume permissions in Stardog images > 7.4.0, c.f. `database-config/docker-compose.stardog.yml`. 


#### metaphactory with RDFox

3. run `cp ./database-config/.env_rdfox .env`. 
4. Open the file `.env` e.g. `vi .env` and perform following changes:
    1. Change the value of the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` variable to a unique name (default is `my-deployment-1`). The name will be used to prefix container names as well as `vhost` entry in the nginx proxy (if used).

5. Please perform additional steps below to prepare the RDFox configuration:
    1. Replace the content of the file at `./database-config/rdfox-config/RDFox.lic` with a valid RDFox license key.
    2. (Optional) The initial value of the `max-memory` server parameter can be adjusted in `.env` using `RDFOX_MAX_MEMORY`. See https://docs.oxfordsemantic.tech/7.0/servers.html#server-parameters for further details

6. Run `docker compose up -d`. It is **important to run the command in the 'my-deployment' folder (containing the .env file)**, since docker-compose will pick up the `.env` file for parameterization.
7. To access the Metaphactory interface, open `http://localhost:10214` and login with user `admin` and password `admin`.
8. To access the RDFox console, open `http://localhost:12110/console/` and login with user `admin` and password `admin`

## Troubleshooting

Please run `docker compose down` before running `docker compose up` after failed attempts (for example due to missing license file), especially if you experience errors like `unknown: Are you trying to mount a directory onto a file (or vice-versa)? Check if the specified host path exists and is the expected type`.

## Accessing docker hostmachine from docker container

* **Linux** If you want to connect to a SPARQL endpoint accessible only on the docker hostmachine, e.g. http://localhost:5828/myDB/query, please identify the IP of your docker0 network using the following command `ip -4 addr show scope global dev docker0 | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d "/" -f 1`. In the file `my-deployment/docker-compose.overwrite.yml` uncomment the line `extra_hosts` and the line below and put the IP of your docker0 network behind 'hostmachine:', e.g. - hostmachine:172.17.0.1. Now, the SPARQL endpoint is accessible via http://hostmachine:<port>/<path>, for example http://hostmachine:5820/myDB/query. Use this URL in your repository setup.
* **Mac/Windows** (for development purposes only) The host is accessible using the pre-configured hostname `host.docker.internal` from docker version 18.03 onwards.

## Connecting a Git Storage for Knowledge Graph Asset Management

As part of Asset Management metaphactory supports maintaining versions of assets (e.g. ontologies or vocabularies) in a central Git repository. To enable version control it is required to configure and connect to such a Git Storage. The detailed steps for doing so are described in https://help.metaphacts.com/resource/Help:AssetStorageConfig.


## Update of Deployments
The most frequent use-case will be updating the runtime (i.e. software) container, for example, of the metaphactory, but leaving the deployment specific data and configuration assets untouched. 

1. Modify the .env file in the folder of the deployment you want to update and increase/change the docker version tag of the metaphactory container i.e. `METAPHACTORY_IMAGE`.
2. Run `docker compose up -d` will re-create only the containers, that have been changed.

## Deletion of Deployments
Run `docker compose down` in the folder for deployment you want to purge. Please note, that **all containers and non-external volumes and networks** for the deployment will be removed and deleted. Make sure that you are in the correct folder (where the respective `.env` file for the deployment is located), before executing the down command.

## Optional Setup: Activate HTTPS connector in metaphactory

metaphactory is typically run behind a reverse proxy (e.g. nginx or AWS ALB) which takes care of TLS termination and certificate handling. This is the preferred setup as this moves certificate handling etc. to a centrally managed endpoint and avoids having to configure all aspects of HTTPS/TLS communication within the metaphactory container.

When encrypted access to metaphactory is required, e.g. because the container is directly exposed to other services without a reverse proxy  or for encrypted communication within the service network in some environments, the HTTPS connector can be exposed as well.

The container by default runs a https connector on port `8443` with a self-signed certificate. When encrypted access is desired this port needs to be exposed to any port in the outside world, e.g. `10213`. This can be done by un-commenting the corresponding line in `docker-compose.overwrite.yml`.


In case required by the environment: the container-internal ports can also be adjusted by specifying the following properties using environment variable `PLATFORM_JETTY_OPTS`: `PLATFORM_JETTY_OPTS=jetty.http.port=8081 jetty.ssl.port=8444`

Jetty will use a self-signed certificate by default and the keystore is located in `/var/lib/jetty/etc/keystore.p12`. 
To use a custom certificate this keystore can be replaced, e.g. using a Docker volume (just) for that file, specifying the location and keystore password by adding the following settings to the environment variable `PLATFORM_JETTY_OPTS` (e.g. in the `.env` file).
    
The following example provides a snippet for the keystore `mykeystore.p12` with password `changeit`. This can be used in `docker-compose.overwrite.yml`.


		services:
		  metaphactory:
		    # metaphactory overwrites here
		    #...
		    volumes:
		      - ./mykeystore.p12:/var/lib/jetty/etc/mykeystore.p12
		    environment:
		      - PLATFORM_JETTY_OPTS=jetty.sslContext.keyStorePath=etc/mykeystore.p12 jetty.sslContext.keyStorePassword=changeit jetty.sslContext.keyManagerPassword=changeit

**Notes:**

* The keystore path is **always** relative to `/var/lib/jetty/`, so any externally injected keystore file must be placed there!
* It is recommended to place a single certificate into the keystore, and assign the alias `jetty`
* For managing keystores the JDK provided keytool, or visual tools (such as the [Keystore Explorer](https://keystore-explorer.org/)) can be used
* The environment setting `PLATFORM_JETTY_OPTS` must not use quotes
* The default password for the Jetty provided `keystore.p12` is `changeit`


## Optional Setup: NGINX Proxy Container

**Please note:**

* This setup is currently not compatible with Windows hosts

It is recommended to use a proxy container with virtual host mappings to proxy the incoming HTTP traffic to the individual container instances. Reasons are:

* Security
    * Not every container/deployment should expose a port (neither on localhost nor to the outside network). Firewall needs to open only two ports.
    * SSL certificate handling in a single place. Instead of dealing with certificates individually or using self-signed certificates, there will be only one officially signed wildcard certificate. One-time installation, valid for all deployments.
    * Ability to automatically issue certificates with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
    * Easy to .htaccess protect containers/deployments that have no built-in authentication mechanism
* Dealing with hostnames is much easier than dealing with IPs and Ports
    * Changes to the underlying (container) setup/infrastructure can be handled transparently.
* Single place for special HTTP settings i.e. easy to enable CORS, GZIP, HTTP2 or modifying HTTP header for individual or all deployments.
	
**Prerequisites:**

* Wildcard CNAME record for the hostname DNS entry e.g. *.mydocker.example.com
* Inbound rules for Port 80, 443 in firewall
* Wildcard SSL certificate for the DNS entry *.mydocker.example.com placed in `/home/docker/config/nginx/certs`. Obviously, it is not required to use HTTPS. However, while the obvious reason for taking this extra step is security, there is another positive side-effect: Performance i.e. only with HTTPS new HTTP2 features are available, which will greatly speed-up the performance of many client-side applications.

### Setup
1. Create a copy of the provided `config template` folder i.e. `cp -r nginx/service-template nginx/config`. The idea is to maintain a deployment specific configuration. In the metaphactory AMI the prepared location is `/opt/metaphactory/docker-compose/nginx/config`.
2. Copy the SSL certificate to `config/certs` i.e. the *.key file and *.crt file must be named equivalent to the hostname (e.g. mydocker.example.com.key and mydocker.example.com.crt). Note that the same holds if you have a wildcard certificate for *.mydocker.example.com. Make sure to set proper permissions to protect the key file (i.e. docker must be able to read it, but no one else). The *.crt file should contain only the certificate body (from `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ` to `-----END CERTIFICATE----- `) and also all intermediate certificates/root certificate required for the certificate chain. You can simple concatenate these, however, order matters:

		-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- 
		(Your Primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt) 
		-----END CERTIFICATE----- 
		-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- 
		(Your Intermediate certificate: xCertCA.crt) 
		-----END CERTIFICATE----- 
		-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- 
		(Your Root certificate: TrustedRoot.crt) 
		-----END CERTIFICATE----

3. Go into the `certs` folder i.e. `cd ./nginx/config/certs` and generate [Diffie–Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) parameters using `openssl dhparam -dsaparam -out mydocker.example.com.dhparam.pem 4096`. `-dsaparam` [option instructs OpenSSL to produce "DSA-like" DH parameters ](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Manual:Dhparam(1)#OPTIONS) , which is magnitude faster then computing the dhparam 4096 (see explanation [on stackexchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/95184))
Go into folder `nginx/config`
4. Now we are ready to create and start the proxy container. Running `docker compose up -d` should result in:
		Creating network "nginx_proxy_network" with the default driver
		Creating nginx-proxy ...
		Creating nginx-proxy ... done

5. Verify with `docker ps` that a container `nginx-proxy` is running with two ports exposed: ```80, 443```
6. From now on the `nginx-proxy` will listen to container changes on the docker daemon. As soon as a new docker container instance is started with an environment variable  `VIRTUAL_HOST={name}.mydocker.example.com`, nginx will automatically create a vhost entry to proxy incoming HTPP(S) request on `{name}.mydocker.example.com` to the respective container. The environment variable is automatically set when using the metaphactory `docker-compose.yml` as described above. It uses the `HOST_NAME` and the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` from the `.env` file and exposes it as `VIRTUAL_HOST` to be picked up by the nginx environment. Alternatively, the `VIRTUAL_HOST` variable can be explicitly defined in the `docker-compose.overwrite.yml` in the `environment` section. Note that `VIRTUAL_PORT` can be optionally used if either multiple containers are exposed through nginx or when your container exposes more than one port.
7. The metaphactory container needs to be configured to use the `nginx_proxy_network` as default external network, e.g. by adding the following snippets to the `docker-compose.overwrite.yml` in the active service instance:

		metaphactory:
		  networks:
		    - default

		networks:
		  default:
		    external:
		      name: nginx_proxy_network

8. Some final fine-tuning of configuration can be done in `nginx/config/conf.d/proxy.conf`. The body size can be increased as needed e.g. by other front- or backend-containers and depending on the use-cases (nginx's default is usually 2MB for security reasons, whereas the metaphactory platform uses usually 100MB as a default). The `proxy_read_timeout` setting can be adjusted to configure the HTTP read timeouts, e.g. for long running queries it may be required to increase the timeout. In order to activate changes restart the `nginx-proxy` with `docker restart nginx-proxy` to load the configuration. 
9. See also [here](nginx/readme.md) for more details on Nginx Security hardening

**Please Note:** 

* If you do not want to use HTTPS, make sure to not have any SSL certificates in the `certs` folder. The volumes section of the `docker-compose` files is also the place to be modified, in case you want to use a different location to place your configuration files including specific vhost configs or certificates. For details, please refer to the official [nginxproxy/nginx-proxy documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxproxy/nginx-proxy).<br><br>
* If you do not want to or are not able to use the nginx proxy at all (for example, you do not have a DNS entry for your host), you can still use the compose scripts to maintain your deployments. However, you will need to map/expose the metaphactory docker container port `8080` to a free host port (you basically need one port / deployment). Simply uncomment and modify the ports section in the `docker-compose.overwrite.yml` file of the service template.

### Optional: Setup with Let's Encrypt
For Let's Encrypt the system should be accessible from the outside world. Otherwise the setup is exactly the same as for default nginx. In order to activate Let's Encrypt uncomment the respective line in the `nginx/config/.env` file (see file comments for details).

Note that in addition to the `VIRTUAL_HOST` the nginx generator tool inspects the `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` and `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` (which are by default defined through the respective settings in `.env` or alternatively explicitly defined as environment variable).
